# Muscles Framework

A simple responsive framework for mobile friendly development. Muscles Framework takes its roots from [dhg/Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton) and [skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework](https://github.com/skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework), with the added components you've come to expect in a modern front-end framework.

## The Basics

Muscles takes the simple Skeleton CSS framework and adds modern UI components in CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Any necessary library code (e.g. Normalize.css) is compiled into the release version, so you don't have to include jQuery or any other library to make it work. If you don't need it (or you've already included it further up your dependency chain), simply download the source and compile without it. 

## Note

This is very much a work in progress. Before adding components I need to extract the bits I want and refactor to SCSS to fit my development workflow. Once that's done, the real fun will begin.

## Usage

Honestly, right now you probably shouldn't use it. Use [skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework](https://github.com/skeleton-framework/skeleton-framework) instead.
